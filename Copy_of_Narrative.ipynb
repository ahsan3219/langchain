        "ESSAY: The morning I woke up, I realized it was the day to take care of George the monkey at our local zoo. I got up and rode my bike to the zoo. I found George jumping and hopping around in his cage. It was going to be a busy day.\n",
        "\n",
        "When I got  the key from the zoo manager he told me, \"Make sure you keep a good eye on George.  Once he spots things that he has never seen before, he will go after them and will try to figure out what they do. It will cause alot of trouble.\" \"Ok,\" I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I got out George and I put him on the handle bars of my bike.  We rode off down the rocky street heading toward the sandy beach. I was riding full speed on my bike with George and then he saw something that made him leap.  But I caught him by the tail. \"That was close!\" I said. When we arrived at the beach, George clung to my back, horrified of the crashing waves in the ocean.  \"It is alright, the waves will not hurt you,\" I said.  But still he clung to my back, even stronger than before.  It is going to take a while for him not to be frightened.\n",
        "\n",
        "I sat down on the sand and started digging.  With curiosity, he started to dig too. He was as fast as a tornado, and he dug as deep as the deepest parts of the ocean.  Soon the hole we dug began to fill up with water, dunking me and the monkey completely under water! The monkey screamed with loud shrieking noises that I have never heard before.\n",
        "\n",
        "I grabbed the monkey right before he started to sink to the bottom. The monkey was grasping for air, but after a few minutes he was fine.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was already noon so we got on my bike and rode to Nick's Sandwich store. But, when we got there the sign said \"No animals of any kind!\". In disappointment we left.  We got on my bike and looked for somewhere to eat that allowed monkeys.  I looked across the street and saw a produce stand on the side of the street.  We parked my bike against a tree and walked up to the stand. I picked up a bundle of bananas and put it in a bag.  \"Now what am I going to eat?\" I said.  Looking around, I found an apple and some strawberries.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had just enough money to buy them. The lady at the register said my little monkey was cute.   With a smile I said, \"he is more than cute, he is a handful.\" She smiled back.   George and I got on the bike again and started riding down the rocky street.\n",
        "\n",
        "We stopped at Dixie's Park to eat our fruit.  George chowed down loudly on his bananas, while I bit into my apple and plopped the strawberries into my mouth.   When we were done we went on the monkey bars ( which George loved) and swung on them for a little while.  Then, we went down the slide which George do not really like.\n",
        "\n",
        "I looked at my watch and it was already three o'clock.\" We have been here awhile. \" I think we should go somewhere else,\" I said  to George.\n",
        "\n",
        "We rode down the rocky road and came back up to the zoo. \" How about we go and look at the different kinds of animals that live around you?\" I said.  So, we parked the bike and walked up to the entrance.  George went wild!  He didn't want to go back to his cage in the zoo. \"We're just going to take a look at all the different animals,\" I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "First we looked at the giraffes.   They where fascinating. Then we looked at the Elephants.   I think they were George's favorite animal at the zoo. Then we looked at the gorillas, and last but not least, the lions!  George made faces at them and then they roared at him.   But George didn't care.  It was time to put George back in his cage .  He clung to my back and he clung hard!  \"I promise I will come back and see you here at the zoo,\" I said as I hugged George goodbye and put him in his cage.   It was sad to see him go, but I had to put him back in his cage. Both of us will never forget what happened today.  I had so much fun with George.\n",
